# Visual Tool Setup

### Installation

1. Git clone this repo (make sure to place this repo in the directory of where your other Retico modules are).
2. In order to run and match the dependencies for the frontend you will need to install [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
3. After installing check with ```npm -v``` to make sure you installed it correctly.
4. In order to match the dependences for the backend you need to install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
5. Check if uv is installed correctly with ```uv --version```.
6. Run ```uv sync``` within the terminal to get all backend dependencies.

### How to Run
